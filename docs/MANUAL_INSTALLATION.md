# Manual installation

This is the *first* installation guide.
If you are already using the lib, use the [migrations guides](../MIGRATION.md).

**You should install this library with this command:**

```bash
ng add @ngx-pwa/local-storage
```

If it causes an error, please file an issue.

In the meantime, you can proceed to a manual installation, but be sure to follow all the steps below.

## Installing the package

Install the right version according to your Angular one via [`npm`](http://npmjs.com):

```bash
# For Angular 11:
npm install @ngx-pwa/local-storage@next

# For Angular 10:
npm install @ngx-pwa/local-storage@10

# For Angular 9:
npm install @ngx-pwa/local-storage@9
```
