# Manual installation

This is the *first* installation guide. If you are already using the lib, use the [migrations guides](../MIGRATION.md).

**You should install this library with this command:**

```bash
ng add @ngx-pwa/local-storage
```

If it causes an error, please file an issue. In the meantime, you can proceed to a manual installation.

## Installing the package

Install the right version according to your Angular one via [`npm`](http://npmjs.com):

```bash
# For Angular 19:
npm install @ngx-pwa/local-storage@^19.0.0

# For Angular 18:
npm install @ngx-pwa/local-storage@^18.0.0

# For Angular 17:
npm install @ngx-pwa/local-storage@^17.0.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> Angular versions <= 16 are [officially outdated](https://angular.dev/reference/versions).
