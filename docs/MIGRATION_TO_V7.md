# Migration guide to version 7

> [!WARNING]
> [Angular version 7 is officially outdated](https://angular.dev/reference/versions), so this version is not supported anymore.
> Also, due to unforeseen and unfixable TypeScript issues, **v7 is deprecated**. For Angular 7, it is recommended to:
> - stay on v6 of the lib,
> - or upgrade to Angular 8 and use v8 of the library (see the [v8 migration guide](./MIGRATION_TO_V8.md)).
