# Migration guide to version 13

## Requirements

First, be sure to:
- fully upgrade *all* your Angular packages (check with `ng version`)
- as stated in the official [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/guide/releases):

> If you are updating from one major version to another, then we recommend that you don't skip major versions. Follow the instructions to incrementally update to the next major version, testing and validating at each step. For example, if you want to update from version 11.x.x to version 13.x.x, we recommend that you update to the latest 12.x.x release first. After successfully updating to 12.x.x, you can then update to 13.x.x.

**So if you update from version < 9, please do the [other migrations](../MIGRATION.md) first**.
The version 9 migration is especially important, as a wrongly done migration could lead to
the loss of all previously stored data.

## How to update

Then:

```
ng update @ngx-pwa/local-storage
```

Done!

## Breaking changes

### Internet Explorer is dead

Angular 13 dropped IE 11 support, and so this lib too.
