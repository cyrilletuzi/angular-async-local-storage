# Migration guide to version 6

## Previous migrations

If you come from the old `angular-async-local-storage` package,
you'll need to **[migrate to the new `@ngx-pwa/local-storage` package](./MIGRATION_TO_NEW_PACKAGE.md)**
first before upgrading to v6.

## Shorter classes names

For shorter code and more consistency, the `Async` prefix has been dropped everywhere.

You can easily and quickly migrate by doing **a global search/replace of**:
- **`AsyncLocalStorage` => `LocalStorage`**
- `AsyncLocalDatabase` => `LocalDatabase`
- `ALSGetItemOptions` => `LSGetItemOptions`

In most cases, you're probably only using the first one.

## No more `NgModule`

`LocalStorageModule` is no longer needed and so it is removed.
Services are provided directly when injected in Angular >=6.

Just **delete the `LocalStorageModule` import in your `AppModule`**.

Done.
