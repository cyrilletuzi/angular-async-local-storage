# Migration guide to version 10

> [!WARNING]
> [Angular version 10 is officially outdated](https://angular.dev/reference/versions), so this version is not supported anymore.

## How to update

```
ng update @ngx-pwa/local-storage
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your project is actually in a version < 9, please do the [other migrations](../MIGRATION.md) first in an incremental way. **The version 9 migration is especially important**, as a wrongly done migration could lead to the loss of all previously stored data.
