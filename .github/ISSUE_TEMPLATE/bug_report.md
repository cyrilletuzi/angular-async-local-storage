Given my current professional situation and the lack of support for my open source work, this library is in a frozen state, meaning the only issues accepted are:
- *production* security issues
- Angular or RxJS breaking changes that would make the lib unusable

# Checks before posting an issue

- [ ] I have read _all_ the library's documentation:
  - [README](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/blob/main/README.md)
  - [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
  - [MIGRATION](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/blob/main/MIGRATION.md)
  - [/docs](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/tree/main/docs)
- [ ] I have checked in already:
  - [opened issues](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues)
  - [closed issues](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)
  - [questions answered](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/discussions/categories/q-a) in the new "Discussions" tab
- [ ] I understand I am writing to a *human being*, doing this open source project *unpaid*
- [ ] I will be involved in my own issue, by answering questions and informing if the issue is resolved

<!-- Otherwise the issue will be closed. -->
