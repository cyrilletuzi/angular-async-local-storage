# Changelog

This lib is fully documented and so you'll find detailed [migration guides](./MIGRATION.md).

## 6.2.5 & 8.0.2 (2019-06-19)

### Bug fix

- Same fix as previous release, but makes it work for all browsers
(fixes [#118](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/118))

## 6.2.4 & 8.0.1 (2019-06-05)

### Bug fix

- When storage is fully disabled in browser (via the "Block all cookies" option),
just trying to check `indexedDB` or `localStorage` variables causes a security exception,
and all Angular code will fail. So the lib is now catching the error,
and fallbacks to in-memory storage in this case.

## 8.0.0 (2019-05-29)

**A [full migration guide to version 8](./docs/MIGRATION_TO_V8.md) is available.**

### Angular 8

v8 requires Angular 8.

### Feature: new `StorageMap` service

See the [general documentation](./README.md).

### Feature: validation is much easier!

- The schema used for validation can (and should) be passed directly as the second argument of `getItem()`
- The returned type of `getItem()` is now inferred for basic types (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) and arrays of basic types (`string[]`, `number[]`, `boolean[]`)
- Just use the new `JSONSchema` interface, IntelliSense will adjust itself based on the `type` option

See the new [validation guide](./docs/VALIDATION.md).

### Full review

This lib started as a little project and is now the first Angular library used for local storage.
It was time to do a full review and refactoring, which results in:

- Better error management (see [README](./README.md#errors))
- Better documentation
- Better overall code (= easier to contribute)

### Other features

- `indexedDB` database and object store names default values are exported and can be changed
(see the [interoperability guide](./docs/INTEROPERABILITY.md))
- When trying to store `null` or `undefined`, `removeItem()` instead of just bypassing (meaning the old value was kept)

### Breaking changes

- **`type` now required for array, object, const and enum validation schemas**
- `JSONSchemaNull` removed (useless, `null` doesn't require any validation)
- `JSONSchema` no longer accepts extra properties
- `getUnsafeItem()` is removed (was already deprecated in v7)

### Future breaking changes

- `.has()`, `.keys()` and `.size` are deprecated in `LocalStorage`. They will be removed in v9. They moved to the new `StorageMap` service.
- `JSONSchemaNumeric` deprecated (will be removed in v9)
- `LSGetItemsOptions` deprecated (not necessary anymore, will be removed in v9)
- `LOCAL_STORAGE_PREFIX`, `LocalStorageProvidersConfig` and `localStorageProviders()` deprecated (will be removed in v9). Moved to `StorageModule.forRoot()`
- `setItemSubscribe()`, `removeItemSubscribe()` and `clearSubscribe()` deprecated (will be removed in v9)

### Reduced public API

Should not concern you as it was internal stuff.

- `IndexedDBDatabase` and `LocalStorageDatabase` not exported anymore
- `MockLocalDatabase` renamed and not exported anymore

## 7.4.1 (2019-01-27) / 5.3.6 and 6.2.3 and 7.4.2 (2019-02-25)

### Documentation

- No code change, only changes in documentation to prepare changes in v8 by recommending to:
  - explicit `type` in every JSON schema, especially `type: 'array'` and `type: 'object'` which were optional but will be required in v8
  - prefer the generic `JSONSchema` interface (v7 only)
  - avoid constants and enums validation (v7 only)
  - avoid `null` in JSON schemas
  - avoid adding unsupported extra properties in JSON schemas
  - use `localStorageProviders()` for configuration instead of `LOCAL_STORAGE_PREFIX`

## 7.4.0 (2019-01-12)

### Feature

- `has()` and `keys()` now work in Edge/IE too
(fixes [#69](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/69))

Do *not* use: it's deprecated in v8.

## 7.3.0 (2019-01-03)

### Feature

- `getItem()` and `setItem()` will now work with values stored from elsewhere
(ie. via the native APIs or via another lib like `localForage`), given some limitations and adaptations
(see the [interoperability documentation](./docs/INTEROPERABILITY.md))
(fixes [#65](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/65))

## 5.3.3 and 6.2.2 and 7.2.2 (2019-01-02)

### Bug fix

- Avoid throwing when storing `undefined` in `localStorage` fallback

## 5.3.2 and 6.2.1 and 7.2.1 (2018-12-12)

### Bug fix

- Correct validation for required vs optional properties (fixes [#63](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/63))

## 7.2.0 (2018-11-27)

### Feature

- Added a partial `Map`-like API:
  - `.keys()` method
  - `.has(key)` method
  - `.size` property

In v7.2, `has()` and `keys()` were not supported in Internet Explorer and Edge. Update to v7.4.

Do *not* use: it's deprecated in v8.

See [documentation](./docs/MAP_OPERATIONS.md).

### Breaking change (from v7.1 only)

One of the features released in 7.1 caused an unforeseen critical regression.
As it concerned only a minor feature introduced in 7.1, released only 4 days ago
(so probably no one is using it yet), decision has been made to do an exceptional breaking change
of this just released minor feature, before it was too late.

- `keys()` is now returning `Observable<string[]>` (returning directly an array with all keys)
instead of `Observable<string>` (it was iterating over the keys).

[Documentation](./docs/MAP_OPERATIONS.md) has been updated accordingly.

## 7.1.0 (2018-11-23) & 7.1.1 (2018-11-26)

These releases have been **deprecated** due to a critical regression.

## 7.0.0 (2018-10-19)

- Support of Angular 7

### Feature

- New interfaces for better validation of your JSON schemas:
  - `JSONSchemaConst`
  - `JSONSchemaEnum`
  - `JSONSchemaString`
  - `JSONSchemaNumeric` (deprecated in v8)
  - `JSONSchemaBoolean`
  - `JSONSchemaArray`
  - `JSONSchemaObject`

See the [full validation guide](./docs/VALIDATION.md) for more info.

### Breaking change

A [migration guide to version 7](./docs/MIGRATION_TO_V7.md) is available.
**Be sure to read it before upgrading**, as v7 introduces an important major change.
Validation of data is now required when using `getItem()`:

- `getItem<string>('test', { schema: { type: 'string' } })`: no change

- `getItem<string>('test')`: now returns the new TypeScript 3 `unknown` type instead of `any`, requiring from you to check the data manually

**Migration is not urgent: while you manage this breaking change, you can just upgrade to v6.2.0, which is compatible with Angular 7.**

## 6.2.0 (2018-10-19)

### Feature

- Allow Angular 7 in `peerDependencies`

## 6.1.1 and 5.3.1 (2018-09-29)

### Bug fix

- Fixed `IndexedDB setter issue : Key already exists in the object store` when there are concurrent `setItem` calls
(note this situation should *not* happen, see [#47](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/47) for details)

## 6.1.0 (2018-08-13)

### Feature

- Fallback to `localStorage` if `IndexedDb` connection fails (fixes
[#26](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/26) and
[#42](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/42))

## 6.0.0 (2018-07-26)

### Features

- New JSON Schema validation options supported (see [#18](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/18) for the full list).

- `localStorageProviders({ prefix: 'myapp' })` to avoid collision in multiple apps on same subdomain 

### Breaking changes

A [migration guide](./docs/MIGRATION_TO_V6.md)
is available to ease the update. It's just a couple of refactorings.
(If you want to contribute,
[it could be automated](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/31).)

#### New requirements

#### Supported version

- Angular 6
- TypeScript 2.7, 2.8 & 2.9

#### New classes names

- `AsyncLocalStorage` removed, renamed to `LocalStorage`.
- `AsyncLocalDatabase` removed, renamed to `LocalDatabase`.
- `ALSGetItemOptions` removed, renamed to `LSGetItemOptions`.

#### No more `LocalStorageModule`

`LocalStorageModule` no longer needed and so removed. **You must delete the import in your `AppModule`.**

#### Validation

- To be consistent with the strict validation, and to prepare future enhancement of JSON Schema typings,
it is no longer possible to specify an array for `type`.
- `JSONSchemaType` has been removed. It should very unlikely concern you, it was an internal type.

#### Others

- Distribution files and directories have been changed to match
official [Angular Package Format v6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/edit).
It affects your code only if you were manually loading UMD bundles,
otherwise building tools like Angular CLI / webpack know where to find the files.

### Internal changes for better performance

- Tree-shakable providers.
- Full support of official [Angular Package Format v6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/edit)

## 6.0.0-rc.2 (2018-07-23)

### Breaking change

- Distribution files and directories have been changed to match
official [Angular Package Format v6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs/edit).
It affects your code only if you were manually loading UMD bundles,
otherwise building tools like Angular CLI / webpack know where to find the files.

## 6.0.0-rc.1 (2018-07-11)

### Bug fix

- `localStorageProviders({ prefix: 'myapp' })` feature was adding the prefix twice.

### Breaking change

- If you were using previous v6 RC (v5 is not concerned) and relying on the `prefix` option above,
your app will restart from empty data.
If you want to keep your previous data, double the prefix, for example: `localStorageProviders({ prefix: 'myapp_myapp' })`

## 5.3.0 (2018-05-03)

### Feature

- `localStorageProviders({ prefix: 'myapp' })` to avoid collision in multiple apps on same subdomain

## 5.1.1 (2018-04-07)

### Bug fix

- Correct too wide type inference for `getItem()`

## 5.1.0 and 4.1.0 (2018-04-07)

### Refactoring

- `AsyncLocalStorageModule` deprecated (but still working). Renamed to `LocalStorageModule`
- `AsyncLocalStorage` deprecated (but still working). Renamed to `LocalStorage`
- `AsyncLocalDatabase` deprecated (but still working). Renamed to `LocalDatabase`
- `ALSGetItemOptions` deprecated (but still working). Renamed to `LSGetItemOptions`

See the [migration guides](./MIGRATION.md).

## 5.0.0 (2018-04-03)

### New package name

This lib has been renamed from `angular-async-local-storage` to `@ngx-pwa/local-storage`. See the [migration guide](./docs/MIGRATION_TO_NEW_PACKAGE.md).

### Version alignement

This lib major version is now aligned to the major version of Angular. Meaning this v5 is for Angular 5. Same as v3.1.4.

## 4.0.0 (lts) (2018-04-03)

### New package name

This lib has been renamed from `angular-async-local-storage` to `@ngx-pwa/local-storage`. See the [migration guide](./docs/MIGRATION_TO_NEW_PACKAGE.md).

### Version alignement

This lib major version is now aligned to the major version of Angular. Meaning this v4 is for Angular 4. Same as v2.

We follow [Angular LTS support](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/docs/RELEASE_SCHEDULE.md),
meaning we support Angular 4 until October 2018. So we backported some bug fixes:

- Detect if storages are null or undefined (partially fixes (partially fixes [#26](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/26))
- Correctly complete observables (fixes [#25](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/25) & [#5](https://github.com/cyrilletuzi/angular-async-local-storage/issues/5))
- Some IndexedDB connection errors were not caught
